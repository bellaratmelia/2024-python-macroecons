    -   Bachelor of IT, MSc in Info Studies.

    -   Have been with SMU since the pandemic era (2021).

-   About this workshop:

    -   Live-coding format; code along with me!

    -   Goal of workshop: to give you enough fundamentals (at least to the point where ChatGPT can't bluff you so easily) and confidence to explore python on your own.

    -   Don't be afraid to ask for help! We are all here to learn

    -   Comes with quizzes!
