The workshop is jointly organised by SEIC and DSA student clubs from SMU, in collaboration with SMU Libraries. The workshop aims to:

-  Increase studentsâ€™ efficiency in the collection, analysis, and visualisation of data with Python.

-  Help SEIC students to be industry-ready as the banking and finance, macroeconomic research, and public sectors are increasingly demanding the use of Python.

-  Expose DSA students to how Python can be integrated with macroeconomic research.
