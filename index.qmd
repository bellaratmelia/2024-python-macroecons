## Welcome!

This site serves as a repository for the slides and codes developed for the 'Macroeconomics with Python Workshop' for SEIC x DSA club members at [SMU](https://www.smu.edu.sg/). 

The workshop aims to:

-  Increase studentsâ€™ efficiency in the collection, analysis, and visualisation of data with Python.

-  Help SEIC students to be industry-ready as the banking and finance, macroeconomic research, and public sectors are increasingly demanding the use of Python.

-  Expose DSA students to how Python can be integrated with macroeconomic research.

## Pre-workshop activities

### Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code

This workshop will use Visual Studio Code, or VS Code. It is a free, versatile code editor that supports many programming languages, including Python. It offers a user-friendly interface for writing and running Python code, and with the right extensions, it can also handle Jupyter notebooks.
