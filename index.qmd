## Important - Please bring your laptop & charger to the workshop

As this is a hands-on workshop, please do bring your laptop. Tablets like Surface or iPad will not be sufficient as they could not run Visual Studio Code.

## Pre-workshop activities

This workshop will use Visual Studio Code, or VS Code. It is a free, versatile code editor that supports many programming languages, including Python. It offers a user-friendly interface for writing and running Python code, and with the right extensions, it can also handle Jupyter notebooks!

**Please install the following things in your laptop before the workshop:**

1.  Download and install the latest [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for your machine (should be version 3.12 or thereabouts).

    -   If you are on Windows, at the start of the installation, **tick the "Add Python 3.12 to PATH"**.

2.  Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). Check out the setup instructions for [Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows) and [macOS](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac)

3.  Once you've installed Visual Studio code, start it up. Open the **Extension** tab on the left sidebar (`Ctrl + Shift + X` on Windows or `Cmd + Shift + X` on macOS) and install the [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extension. (The extension creator should be Microsoft)
