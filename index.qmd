## Important - Please bring your laptop & charger to the workshop

As this is a hands-on workshop, please do bring your laptop. Tablets like Surface or iPad will not be sufficient as they could not run Visual Studio Code.
:::

## Pre-workshop activities

This workshop will use Visual Studio Code, or VS Code. It is a free, versatile code editor that supports many programming languages, including Python. It offers a user-friendly interface for writing and running Python code, and with the right extensions, it can also handle Jupyter notebooks!

**Please install the following things in your laptop before the workshop:**

1.  Download and install the latest [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for your machine (should be version 3.12 or thereabouts).

    -   If you are on Windows, at the start of the installation, **tick the "Add Python 3.12 to PATH"**.

2.  Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). Check out the setup instructions for [Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows) and [macOS](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac)

3.  Once you've installed Visual Studio code, start it up. Open the **Extension** tab on the left sidebar (`Ctrl + Shift + X` on Windows or `Cmd + Shift + X` on macOS) and install the [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extension. (The extension creator should be Microsoft)

4.  Fill up the [**pre-workshop survey**](https://smusg.asia.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1Nx06jl6oFCnNNY)! Please fill this up before the beginning of session 1.

## Datasets

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" title="What is a CSV?"}

A CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file is a type of file that stores data in a plain text format. Each line in the file represents a row of data, and within each row, individual pieces of data (like numbers or words) are separated by commas.

This format is commonly used for storing and transferring data, especially in spreadsheets and databases. Because it is literally just plain text, it is an ideal format if you have large amount of data.

You can open CSV files in Excel, Google Sheets, or even Notepad!
:::

### Dataset 1: sg-gdp.csv

For session 2 of this workshop, we will be using small dataset stored in a CSV file called `sg-gdp.csv`.

```

### Dataset 2: unemployment-age.csv

For session 3 of this workshop, we will be using small dataset stored in a CSV file called `unemployment-age.csv`. This is a time series data that tracks unemployment rate for various age groups in United States, retrieved from [Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/).
